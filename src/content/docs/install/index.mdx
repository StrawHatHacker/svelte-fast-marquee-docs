import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Install the package with the JS package manager of your choice:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="npm">
		```
		npm install react-fast-marquee
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="yarn">
		```
		yarn add react-fast-marquee
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="pnpm">
		```
		pnpm install react-fast-marquee
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="bun">
		```
		bun add react-fast-marquee
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.
